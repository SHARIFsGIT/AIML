    "### What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is a field of artificial intelligence where computers learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed. Instead of writing rules to solve a problem, we show the computer examples and let it figure out the patterns itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is it used?**\n",
    "- To solve complex problems where writing explicit rules is difficult or impossible\n",
    "- To find hidden patterns in large datasets\n",
    "- To make predictions or decisions based on past experience\n",
    "\n",
    "**What problems does it solve?**\n",
    "- Predicting house prices based on features\n",
    "- Classifying emails as spam or not spam\n",
    "- Recommending products to customers\n",
    "- Recognizing images or speech\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does it work?**\n",
    "1. Collect data with known outcomes\n",
    "2. Split data into training and testing sets\n",
    "3. Train a model on the training data\n",
    "4. Test the model on unseen data\n",
    "5. Evaluate performance and improve\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If we want to predict house prices, we collect data about houses (size, location, age) and their actual selling prices. The model learns how these features affect the price."

    "### What is a Dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset is a collection of data organized in a structured format, typically as rows and columns (like a spreadsheet). In machine learning, datasets contain features (input variables) and targets (what we want to predict).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is it used?**\n",
    "- Provides the raw material for training machine learning models\n",
    "- Allows us to understand patterns and relationships in data\n",
    "- Helps us evaluate model performance on known examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**What problems does it solve?**\n",
    "- Without data, we cannot train or test machine learning models\n",
    "- Provides the ground truth for supervised learning\n",
    "- Enables validation of model predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does it work?**\n",
    "- Each row represents an observation/example (e.g., one house)\n",
    "- Each column represents a feature or attribute (e.g., house size, number of rooms)\n",
    "- The target column contains what we want to predict (e.g., house price)\n",
    "- Quality and quantity of data directly impact model performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In a housing dataset, each row is a house, columns include features like square footage, bedrooms, location, and the target is the selling price."

    "### What is Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is a statistical technique that uses multiple input features to predict a single numeric target variable. It extends simple linear regression (which uses one feature) by incorporating two or more features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is it used?**\n",
    "- To model real-world relationships where outcomes depend on multiple factors\n",
    "- To understand how each feature contributes to the target\n",
    "- To make predictions based on several input variables\n",
    "\n",
    "**What problems does it solve?**\n",
    "- Predicting house prices based on size, location, age, etc.\n",
    "- Estimating sales based on advertising budget, season, and competitor prices\n",
    "- Forecasting crop yields based on rainfall, temperature, and fertilizer use\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does it work?**\n",
    "The model learns a linear equation:\n",
    "```\n",
    "y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + ... + bn*xn\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- y is the target variable\n",
    "- x1, x2, ..., xn are the input features\n",
    "- b0 is the intercept (baseline value when all features are 0)\n",
    "- b1, b2, ..., bn are coefficients (how much each feature affects the target)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Predicting a house price might use:\n",
    "- x1 = square footage\n",
    "- x2 = number of bedrooms\n",
    "- x3 = age of house\n",
    "- x4 = median income in neighborhood\n",

    "### Understanding Model Coefficients and Intercept\n",
    "\n",
    "In Multiple Linear Regression, the model learns:\n",
    "- **Intercept (b₀)**: The predicted value when all features are 0\n",
    "- **Coefficients (b₁, b₂, ..., bₙ)**: How much the target changes for a one-unit increase in each feature\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpreting coefficients:**\n",
    "- Positive coefficient: As the feature increases, the target tends to increase\n",
    "- Negative coefficient: As the feature increases, the target tends to decrease\n",
    "- Larger magnitude: Stronger effect on the target\n",
    "- Near zero: Little effect on the target\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example interpretation:**\n",
    "If MedInc has coefficient 0.5:\n",
    "- For every $10,000 increase in median income (MedInc unit)\n",
    "- House value increases by $50,000 (0.5 × $100,000)\n",
    "- Holding all other features constant\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important considerations:**\n",
    "- Coefficients assume linear relationships\n",
    "- They can be affected by feature scaling\n",
    "- Correlated features can make coefficients unstable\n",
    "- Always consider domain knowledge when interpreting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common mistakes:**\n",
    "- Confusing correlation with causation\n",
    "- Ignoring the scale of features\n",
    "- Not considering feature interactions\n",
    "- Over-interpreting small coefficient differences"

    "### Model Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "When building regression models, we need metrics to evaluate how well our predictions match the actual values. Common metrics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**\n",
    "- Average of absolute differences between predicted and actual values\n",
    "- Easy to interpret (same units as target)\n",
    "- Less sensitive to outliers than MSE\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)**\n",
    "- Average of squared differences between predicted and actual values\n",
    "- Penalizes large errors more heavily (squares amplify them)\n",
    "- Not in original units (squared units)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**\n",
    "- Square root of MSE\n",
    "- In same units as target (unlike MSE)\n",
    "- Most commonly used regression metric\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. R-squared (R²)**\n",
    "- Proportion of variance in target explained by features\n",
    "- Ranges from 0 to 1 (or negative for very poor models)\n",
    "- 0.70 means model explains 70% of variance in target\n",
    "- Higher is better, but can be misleading on non-linear data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpreting metrics:**\n",
    "- Lower MAE/RMSE = better accuracy\n",
    "- Higher R² = better fit (but watch out for overfitting)\n",
    "- Compare training vs test metrics to detect overfitting"

    "### What is Train-Test Split?\n",
    "\n",
    "Train-test split is a fundamental technique in machine learning where we divide our dataset into:\n",
    "- **Training set**: Used to train/fit the model (typically 70-80% of data)\n",
    "- **Test set**: Used to evaluate model performance on unseen data (typically 20-30% of data)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is it used?**\n",
    "- To get an unbiased estimate of model performance\n",
    "- To detect overfitting (when model memorizes training data but can't generalize)\n",
    "- To ensure our model works on new, unseen data\n",
    "\n",
    "**What problems does it solve?**\n",
    "- Prevents \"cheating\" by evaluating on data the model has already seen\n",
    "- Provides a realistic estimate of real-world performance\n",
    "- Helps choose between different models or hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does it work?**\n",
    "1. Randomly shuffle the dataset (with random_state for reproducibility)\n",
    "2. Split into training and test sets based on test_size (e.g., 0.2 = 20%)\n",
    "3. Train model only on training set\n",

    "### What is Polynomial Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomial Regression is a form of linear regression where the relationship between the independent variable X and dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial. Despite the \"polynomial\" name, it's still considered \"linear\" because the model is linear in its coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is it used?**\n",
    "- To capture non-linear relationships in data\n",
    "- When linear regression underfits (high bias)\n",
    "- When residual plots show curved patterns\n",
    "- To model more complex real-world relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "**What problems does it solve?**\n",
    "- Housing prices that don't increase linearly with features\n",
    "- Diminishing returns (e.g., each additional bedroom adds less value)\n",
    "- Optimal points (e.g., crop yield peaks at certain rainfall)\n",
    "- U-shaped or S-shaped relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does it work?**\n",
    "Instead of: y = b₀ + b₁x\n",
    "We use: y = b₀ + b₁x + b₂x² + b₃x³ + ... + bₙxⁿ\n",
    "\n",
    "The model learns coefficients for each polynomial term, allowing curves instead of straight lines.\n",

    "**Important concepts:**\n",
    "- **Degree 1**: Simple linear regression (straight line)\n",
    "- **Degree 2**: Quadratic (parabola) - can model one curve\n",
    "- **Degree 3**: Cubic - can model S-shapes\n",
    "- **Higher degrees**: More complex curves (risk of overfitting)\n",
